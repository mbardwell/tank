* need to implement boost converter, DC motor drive, battery charger. Control handled by ESP8266 Feather Huzzah

* constraints: cost (max tbd), size (4" x 4" x 1"h)


## boost
* boost converter should take 8-12 V to above 20 V

## DC motor drive
* DC motor drive should be PWM or analog value controlled

## battery charger 
* battery charger should balance 6 Li-Po batteries via wall plug charger
