# ESP8266 (NodeMCU) tank control

This project is the first step of my 3D printed tank control project. I bricked a Feather Huzzah, so this is round 2. The project is broken down as follows:

## Dependencies
- Blynk library v0.5.3 by V. Shymanskyy
- passwords.h file in ../lib/foldername/passwords.h which should include _SSID, _PASS and _AUTHTOKEN values
Install using PlatformIO Library Manager
